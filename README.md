# Code for implementing the paper EFFECT OF INJECTED NOISE IN DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

# Requirements
python 2.7,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
scipy

# Running the code
src folder contains the python scripts.
The MNIST database can be found in the data folder.

Run the file run_hid_4_network2.py to implement a deep network with 4 hidden layers and 50 neurons in each WITHOUT noise.
`python run_hid_4_network2.py`

Run the file run_hid_4_network2_aoi.py to implement a deep network with 4 hidden layers and 50 neurons in each with AOI noise.
`python run_hid_4_network2_aoi.py`

Run the file run_hid_4_network2_aoi_randn.py to implement a deep network with 4 hidden layers and 50 neurons in each with AOI noise with randomness.
`python run_hid_4_network2_aoi_randn.py`

Run the file run_hid_4_network2_line_noise.py to implement a deep network with 4 hidden layers and 50 neurons in each with line noise.
`python run_hid_4_network2_line_noise.py`
